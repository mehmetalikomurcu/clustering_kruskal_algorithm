Kruskal's Algorithm Clustering

This project is a Python application that implements clustering using Kruskal's Algorithm. The graphical interface allows users to add, remove, and visualize points on a 2D plane. Users can generate random points, specify the number of clusters, and visualize the results, with different colors representing different clusters.

The clustering process involves calculating the Euclidean distance between points, constructing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and grouping the points into clusters. The application also provides statistical information like cluster sizes, standard deviations, and variances.
